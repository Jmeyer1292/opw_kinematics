* force evaluation of Vector u in forward, fixes `#21 <https://github.com/Jmeyer1292/opw_kinematics/issues/21>`_
  using auto here allowed the compiler to create some sort of computation-object that
  was later handled incorrectly. Not sure if this is a bug in Eigen or g++. It also fixes
  a warning about uninitialized values being used and makes the tests succeed on our
  systems.
* switch to industrial_ci, add eigen dependency
* accept warnings as they stem from ikfast mostly
* Add travis config based on moveit_ci
* Fix printing of joint sign corrections. Print the sign correction as `-1` or `1` instead of the raw character.
* Replaced Affine with Isometry in Readme.md
* Changed license to Apache 2.0
* Replaced Affine with Isometry to better reflect what the solver is working toward
* Added image with positive rotations marked on it
* Added note about the default rotational axis
* Added noexcept to IK & FK calls. Casted all real number literals to the appropriate type. This prevents us from converting doubles to floats all the time and increases speed by quite a bit when you want to use floats.
* Swapped the short int to a signed char. We're just using it for -1 or 1 so it shouldn't matter.
* Made updates to the attribution for the idea behind the test: thanks jeroen demaeyer!
* Added a 'throughput' test for FK/IK for three different robots. No assertions but its nice to have something easy to re-run.
* Added a new set of tests based on JeroenDM's kuka tests that compute FK, solve the IK, and then make sure a new FK matches the original
* Renames abb2400_tests to abb2400_ikfast_tests to better capture the intent of the tests
* Moved the gtests inside a CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING if-clause in the main cmake file
* Add joint sign corrections to parameters
* add ik test for using a single forward kinematics solution
* add simple fk test using a known solution for KukaKR6_R700_sixx
* Update KukaKR6_R700_sixx to match description kuka_experimental package
* add joint sign corrections to parameters and update io function
* Create LICENSE  GPLv3
* Moved some includes around
* Added a doc string pointing to the examples
* Added a few more example robot configurations.
* Documentation - noted that you can store the results in many different formats.
* Added diagram from paper; expanded examples
* Converted all the fixed double math over to templatized code.
* Added some utility headers for harmonization and validity checking.
* Added some documentation
* Added some basic unit tests to compare the OPW and IKFast solutions for the same abb 2400
